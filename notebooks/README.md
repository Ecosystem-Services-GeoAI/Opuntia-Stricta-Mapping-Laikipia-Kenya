This folder holds two Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the project workflow and feature exploration.

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **`main.ipynb`** | End‑to‑end pipeline: data preparation → feature engineering → Random Forest training with cross‑validation → SHAP interpretation → result visualisation. Running this notebook reproduces the key experiments and figures in the paper. |
| **`Feature_Analysis.ipynb`** | Exploratory data analysis and feature diagnostics: value distributions, correlation matrix, DTW examples, etc. Use it to better understand the predictors and guide feature selection. |
